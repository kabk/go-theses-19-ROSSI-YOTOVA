            <p class="paragraph" id="c">I have been guessing which came first. Thought or language? It is logical to assume that thought was first and language is an attempt to express that thought and rationalise
            the world. There are many studies on the relationship between language and thought. In
            brief some conclusions include the ideas that thought and language have interactive relationship
            where language dictates thinking meanwhile thought also influences language. In
            fact there are many non-verbal ways of thinking such as in mental images (visual), kinesthetic,
            musical and mathematical. So this answers my question which existed first.</p>
          </div> 
           <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph" id="d">In general languages are modes for representing our thoughts by the use of arbitrary symbols and combinations of those symbols.5 It is an arrangement, which orders our knowledge with the goal of making it possible to represent in a system of names.
            Humans are “the symbol-using (symbol making, symbol misusing)” being. We are
            “separated from our natural existence by instruments of own making”.6 Languages are
            very old instruments. He describes language as the very centre of our existence and
            through which we exhibit our desires for order, our wish to control the natural world by
            naming its contents, and even our effort to dominate others.</p>
          </div> 
          <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph" id="e">Language is the extension of thinking. It is proven, that we can think and communicate without using language, but nevertheless as we grow up our mind processes are
            being programmed to operate and communicate through the use of signs and symbols.
            Even if we communicate in many other ways, language is still the number one tool we use
            to exchange information and ideas.</p>
          </div> 
          <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph" id="f">In Jean Luc Goddard’s move Alphaville, Alpha 60, the city’s computer system in
            complete control has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like love, poetry,
            and emotion, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether.</p>

            <p class="paragraph" id="g">In the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, Newspeak is a controlled
            language, of restricted grammar and limited vocabulary, meant to limit the freedom of
            thought, personal identity, self-expression, free will, that would ideologically threaten the
            régime of the Party. He goes as far to invent the term “thoughtcrime”. We can speculate
            that in real life it is the same. That the expression of our thoughts happen according
            the possibilities our knowledge of language would allow. Some scientists even believe
            that when learning a new language, we become aware of new perceptual dimensions
            because different languages embody different world views and ways of organising the
            world. For example the perception of time, space, age etcetera. This is true, there are
            even some innumerate societies where counting is not an existing practice.</p>
          </div> 
          <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph" id="h">Because we know how to use language and it is so ubiquitous, we can transmit
            really complicated thoughts to one another. But “language does not just reflect reality, it
            selects reality.” It is not only a description of an experience, but it directs us to look at one
            thing over another. Since human beings depend for their lives more on learned and less
            on genetic information than do other living things, the structure through which information
            is carried exerts a decisive influence on our lives. Language does not merely reflect
            an objective world, but words participate in constructing that world as well. To use language
            is to engage in a construction process, and what is constructed is our view of the
            world. But thinking and perception depend on our previously accumulated knowledge.
            What we already know changes the way we see the world. Knowledge can result in a
            closed and settled perspective, leading to not moving beyond the way in which we
            perceive and deal with problems.</p>
          </div> 
          <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph" id="i">For example in the case with babies. We can’t have a conversation with them,
            because they don’t have any knowledge on the medium of spoken language. That doesn’t
            mean a baby doesn’t have thoughts or anything to say to us. Babies never resemble a
            blank canvas. The beginning of their cognition process is their beginning. Babies’ capacities
            for feeling originate through interaction in the moment they are formed in the womb.
            It could even be that their thinking(cognition) is even greater than ours, since it is not
            mediated through human language. In fact newborn babies communicate between each
            other in their own imaginary languages. They invent those at the moment of their interaction.
            Most of the time to us it sounds like nonsense, but it’s impossible to deny that they
            do exchange some meaning. We are just too biased by our knowledge of institutionalised
            language norms to possibly understand it and engage in such a conversation. In fact they
            are even much better at sensing other people’s emotions than grown up’s can ever be.
            But as they grow up, babies pick up on the language from their environment and start to
            use it for expressing their thoughts. That’s when they start to make sense out of our world
            through the use of language and we can have a sequential conversation with them.</p>

    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">Communication comes from the Latin word communicare, which literary means “to
            share”. In simple words communication is the exchange of facts, ideas, opinions, emotions.
            For communication to happen there must be the sharing of meaning. Words, for
            example, ‘mean’ nothing by themselves. It is only when people make use of them that they
            stand for anything, or, in one sense, have ‘meaning.’ They are instruments for communicating.</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">When we are communicating, we are witnessing each other. That means we continually
            negotiate trust and truth. We witness each others presence.7 This is how we
            establish trust and a sense of truth. We tell each other stories, we laugh, we debate
            and we this is how create meaning and value. And we like to participate an be a part of
            something larger than we as an individual are. Humans have always been part of a social
            group. Be it a tribe, a family, a team, etcetera. When witnessing each other, trust and truth
            are negotiated and as a result social structures are shaped.7 Communication constructs
            social realities in the sense that meaning is created by common ideas and their exchange
            between people. “When negotiating trust and truth, people have to take responsibility for
            their words and deeds. Results of such negotiations, the shared authoring of outcomes,
            inspire meaning to emerge and cultures to rise.” I understand it as letters. Letters receive
            meaning when being part of a bigger structure, as a word or sentence. When creating
            meaning and value (negotiating trust and truth) we decide in which actions to engage
            in, what stories to tell, how to express ourselves.</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">Freud speaks of culture as the fundamental order with which a man “will be dealing and
            within which he will be at home”. These codes are the one governing our schemas of perception,
            our exchanges, our techniques, our values, and the hierarchy of our practices.
            Although a culture could not survive long unless it is a shared understanding. It relies on
            the repetition and reaffirmation of common practices. So the very same codes and practices
            are the ones that we create when we share ideas and understanding. Social structures
            are not organised in closed systems, but rather in open systems. These systems are
            not defined by fixed relations between elements, but by sets of elements in an interaction.
            These millions of interactions effect the course of culture.
            The content of knowledge in this context is the means of a the creation of culture.
            It resembles traditional myths. But we regard old habitual practices and conceptions
            as particularly self-evident, and that is how they create the foundations on which further
            social construction will happen.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">The communication tools we use have the power to translate our experiences into new
            forms. In the same way that language translates our thoughts into the outside world.
            Media are the extensions of the senses.9 We employ media as ways of communicating,
            which makes it a vehicle for defining our personal and cultural identity. By its definition a
            medium(sing. for media) is by definition the intervening substance through which sensory
            impressions are conveyed. Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the
            media by which men communicate then by the content of the communication’.10</p>

    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">The beginning of human communication through channels, different than vocalization
            or gestures, is as ancient as cave paintings, drawn maps and writing. In the beginning
            of civilization there were oral cultures, later on scribal cultures, print cultures and
            nowadays digital cultures. This is how the history of humankind has been more or less
            dominated by a certain kind of medium.11 In traditional oral cultures knowledge, art, ideas
            and cultural material is received, preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to
            another over space and time. Today rely on media to communicate, acquire knowledge
            and information and even find in it solutions to our problems. In a way we have a disembodied
            state of social presence where the absence of our bodies gives new meanings
            to the physicality of experience.</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">The most direct form of communication is touching. But even if media extends our bodies in space and time, it prevents us from touching. Nowadays a significant role in social
            interaction play the screens. The screens have become carriers of information and the
            mediating material of our communication practices. In a conversation the Luna Maurer(
            artist) and Andreas Zangger(historian of transitional networks) talk about humans and
            machines, designing systems and on the participation of their users. They discuss people
            on the streets as man-machine hybrids communicating with someone in a world out there.
            The impact of technology on our interactions is something we all experience on a daily
            basis.</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">So this is why decided to use two examples that are not from the present. To not
            bore potential readers and to give examples of how we create these tools which become
            carriers of our intentions and whose features transform the ways in which we “share”.
            The first example is Socrates’ very old concern of the invention of letters. In the dialogue
            Phaedrus he says the “Discovery of the alphabet will create forgetfulness in the
            learner’s souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust the external
            written characters and not remember of themselves. The specific which you have discovered
            is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and you give your disciples not truth,
            but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned
            nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be
            tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality.”12 In Socrates’ view
            knowledge can only be gathered via a dialogue which is an exchange of questions and
            answers where ideas are explored until the knowledge is truly understood. Reading only
            mislead us to think that we have knowledge, when we only have data. It is a private
            experience of information and alienates us from the world around.</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">I recently found out about a term peep media. There are many examples of such
            devices in the history starting from traditional peep show devices, to the stereoscope and
            now virtual reality. A mainstream stereoscope is a pair of photographic images placed
            inside a hand-held wooden box and observed through a pair of lenses. The two images
            merge as one in the peeper’s mind. The images depicted distant cities and landscapes.
            It became a tool for “world voyaging”, a way to escape your immediate surroundings.
            This quote about the stereoscope comes from an advertising booklet for John Fallon’s
            “Stereopticon” show and gives a critique on the stereoscope when it was still an emerging
            medium. “After all, the picture in the stereoscope is but a miniature, and, besides,
            there is nothing social in the enjoyment of the view revealed to you. You look selfish at
            the show with your personal eyes, and your friends must wait their turn to see it….”. 13</p>

      <img src="images/023.jpg" id="thing" alt="01" class="draggable" class="ui-widget-content" style="margin-top:260%; margin-left: -20%; position: absolute;">

    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">The nature of the stereoscope is antisocial, but it’s popularity and use was maybe
            because it was a personal media machine, manipulated by one’s fingers, capable to
            teleport the users to witness the world, whenever everyday reality becomes boring. It
            was considered as a “highly convincing tool for armchair travelling”. But the act of “armchair
            travelling” creates an active relation between the view, the viewing apparatus and
            the viewer. One that presents us with a tunnel vision and imposes it’s antisocial nature by
            alienating us from immediate reality.</p>
    </div> 

  
    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">In a later dialogue the previously mentioned artist and historian debate “the designing of systems or plays” and their constrains and freedoms. They disscuss the idea of
            rules and resistance in a variety of ways. In the talk they refer to the Ludwick Fleck, for his
            critique on the sociology of knowledge that in science, if the evidence doesn’t fit the theory,
            it is either considered as noise or accepted as a sign of resistance to the theory. They
            talk of designed systems as having a set of rules, multiple participants and a number of
            possible outcomes or developments. Participants react upon another within the given
            boundaries and the set of outcomes which depends on the framework.14 Speaking of
            these systems I do not mean no state that they are all negative, there might in fact be as
            many positive examples as there are negative.</p>
    </div>  
    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">A positive example are games that would engage individuals in an interaction, such
            as entertaining games or sports. Nevertheless these design tactics apply to some other
            domains, such as the construction of the social world. In our everyday life we are
            exchanging participants in a structure of possible or impossible relations, which are
            defined by the set of rules typical for the given context. But there can be a positive side
            of rules. The rules limit our scope of expression. But they also force us to come up with
            creative solutions in order to resist the rules.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">In the 19th century Paris had been a centre of civil unrest which lead to a transition
            between royalty, republic and empire six different times. One of the most useful tools
            of the rioters were sandbags, pavement slabs, wagons and even furniture which they
            used for barricades. By blocking off Paris’ narrow streets, the barricades prevented
            the soldiers trying to restore the civil order. In 1852 Napoleon III gave the responsibility
            to Georges-Eugène Haussmann to re-plan Paris for giving soldiers easy access into all
            corners of the city and preventing the construction of effective barricades. Haussmann
            demolished the city’s streets and built wide open boulevards. By transforming the infrastructure
            of the city he pursued to prevent and therefore limit the possible outcomes of
            civil (inter)actions.15</p>

            navigating a physical space we are following the plan of the architects and urbanist that
            have designed it. The way each one of us navigates is unique to ourself, but the overall
            path we follow is envisioned by the creators of the environment.</p>

            who managed collectively to find a creative solution for a problem by improvising with

            <p class="paragraph">When we dare to reinterpret a concept, an object, a rule, and anything for that mater,
            we allow the chance of discovering new possibilities. In a book “Creativity flow and the
            psychology of discovery and invention”, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explains the phenomena
            of creativity as something that does not happen inside people’s heads, but in the interaction
            between a person’s thoughts and a sociocultural context. Creativity is experiencing
            the world in novel and original ways. When we create something, we do not create it from
            nothing. We take existing materials or ideas and use, transform, merge them accordingly
            to a vision that we have. Creativity is the working of our imagination in context. Imagination
            is closely related to reality. The connection lies in the opportunity that based upon
            reality, imagination provides innovation and possibilities. It helps us to distance ourself
            from the situation and understand that things can be different. When our imagination is at
            work we are able to envision possibilities. Imagination is also an essential part of communication.
            It inspires our thinking and the way we perceive, engage, produce and interact
            with the environment, situation or people. We imagine the others through sympathy. That
            mean to identify with them. When we say “I can imagine how you feel.” Imagination unfolds
            human perception and experience in an unexpected ways.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Anna Carlgreen is a Swedish artist, fascinated by glass and it’s optical properties.
            With her work she demonstrates how minimal alterations can have a monumental
            effect. “Multifaceted glasses can show us things we otherwise would never see or experience.
            She makes a very interesting point when talking about her fascination with
            the kaleidoscope. “The notion that the shape of things could be altered by altering the
            angle of the frame while looking through the glass, was an amazing discovery. … Bold experimentation,
            producing constellations of forms that are very carefully calculated, reveal
            completely new aspects of the refractive capabilities of glass.” 16 I use it here because I
            see the kaleidoscope as a metaphor for a way of observing the world, where the meaning
            of what we perceive in not declared by the outside, but by the way in which we decide to
            look at the outside.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">I found these two images at the beginning of my process. I was very fascinated by
            them and they became main reference points of my research and writing process. The
            first image, which comes from Museum of Internet, is interesting for me because it is
            simply weird and somehow makes a lot of sense, while being very irrational. Usually the
            use of the teapot happens according to the rules imposed by it’s design. It is intended to
            be used in a particular way. We must lift the pot with a hand, position it over the cup and
            than pour into it. The teapot is the medium for serving tea. It’s well thought form defines
            the possible ways in which the teapot could used, but to show one thing means simultaneously
            to conceal something else. In the image the user has engaged in an interaction
            that does not conform to the conventional tea serving practice, while remaining to be
            functional. The woman reinterprets the teapot by interpreting it in a new or different light.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">The second image impressed me on a personal level, but nevertheless this is some
            great problem solving skills in practice. I personally have a great issue with queuing. I
            feel bored, anxious, stresses, even sometimes depressed. All of this while I am not able
            to move back or forth, because I have my own turn, and I must make sure I align with it.
            When queuing we stand in line. In this case though, the participants in the queue have
            managed this horrible practice in an inspiring manner. It serves its purpose, but the action
            of queuing is reinterpreted by the people that are the active participant in the queue and
            not defined by the accepted idea, such as that we should stand in line. Maybe someone
            made it first and than all the rest followed, or maybe it is a common practice at some
            places.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">To keep an open mind means to be willing to reinterpret former norms and conclusions,
            and therefore to allow for the exploration of new possibilities. In his Opera Aparta
            (The open work, 1962) Umberto Eco has described the rise of the concept of “openworks”
            in art. The intention of opening the work is to generate a much more active attitude
            in the listeners, viewers, and readers. This presents the public with a field of possibilities

            word for play/game/pastime/sport, and paides - the word for children have the same
            root. Another term - paidagogia (pedagogy), coming from the same root, was aimed to
            encourage learning as a form of play (paidia) which was considered the most effective approach
            to learning for the free citizens of the society. We can even go as far as to position
            a reciprocal relationship between a society and the games it likes to play. The preferred
            games reflect the dominant trends, tastes, and ways of thinking, meanwhile educating
            and training the players on the virtues of the game. And people confirm them later in their
            habits and preferences.17</p>

    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">Many games do not imply rules, such as playing with locomotives, cars, dolls, puppets
            and other. These games stimulate improvisation, and are a play for play’s sake. But
            in this play fiction is becoming a rule of it’s own. The rule of “as if”.18 People find children
            to be the ultimate creative explorers because of their constant curiosity and the interest
            they invest on anything within range. They are delighted by the unknown. The way in
            which children learn is by playing. By interacting with their environment children engage
            in a feedback with the subject of their exploration and learn by the immediate exchange.
            It could be that their play is so creative because they are not completely aware with the
            rules of the world. Their play engages them is a free form of interaction with the environment. This dialogue with the surrounding is a crucial part for acquiring knowledge. It is
            the same when communicating because a multitude of view points can be observed, and
            varying opinions may create a multitude of opposing views.</p>

            other according to a set of rules that we had to acquire and practice in the context of our
            cultural surrounding. We take part in a sort of communication game dictated more or less
            by the social and educational systems. In society the rules of communication emerge
            from the cultural and technological context we exist in. We exchange information, ideas,
            thoughts. The more we become used to these artificial rules for communicating, the less
            we look for change, the more exposed we are to outside forces and the less we try to engage
            in immediate interactions.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">In games cheating is a subversive action. It is finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation usually by dishonest means.19 It is disobedience against the game.
            Cheaters disrupts the rhythm of the game. In this context I understand it as means to
            escape the rules imposed by our social reality and institutionalised communication. In
            the dictionaries, as well as in society, it is associated with acts of dishonesty and immorality.
            Nevertheless if the rules provide for an unmoral outcome than the one cheating
            would, the act of cheating should be justified because “There is no justice in following
            unjust laws.” Some people might find the connection between cheating and creativity
            bizarre. I relate them in the sense of both being strategies for discovering unconventional
            means of solving a problem or dealing with a difficult situation. If we think about
            cheating in school. In that context cheating would means two things. That these kids
            didn’t learn their lessons for exam and they have found a way out of this situation with a
            very practical solution. We can always argue if it is bad or not they didn’t learn their textbooks.
            But we should credit these students for the way in which they found solutions to
            their problem. Some of the examples are so unexpected that to me they even seems like
            artistry. I am sure everyone had to come up with cheating techniques at least once in our
            lifetime. So we can all relate to how much creative thought and precision this practice
            requires.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">The few reasons why I related game to communication are because they are both
            participatory activities in which we must engage in an active exchange with others, but
            this exchange is always happening according to the rules of the game. Except when
            cheating. Cheaters disrupt the rhythm of the game and break it’s structure open. What
            would cheating in communication mean than depends on how we reinterpret the communication
            tools we have in order to allow an open exchange in a society where sharing and
            interaction would happen freely.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">There is a lot of subversive potential in computer hacking nowadays. When someone
            takes the central productive techniques of contemporary society and diverts them for
            a non profitable or illegal uses, which involves sharing, free cooperation, and many times,
            collective action.20</p>

            <p class="paragraph">An example, although a legal one, is Belingcat, created by Eliot Higgins who in
            2012 started a blog under the pseudonym Brown Moses, through which he published his
            research into video footage of the Syrian Civil War.21 He looked at footage on the Internet,
            localised the video clips and examined details of the weapons which were used. The
            community uses open source tools, such as Google maps and social media investigation
            for citizen journalism. The contributors to the website publish both their case studies and
            guides to the techniques they use in their process. They also use a tool for fact-checking
            called Meedan’s Checkdesk, which allows a collaborative and transparent verification
            of content. I find it a beautiful example because of two thing. How we can transform the
            purpose of the digital media we are clustered with and how people invent new practices
            of sharing, because we know how manipulated mainstream media information is.22</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Hackers’ desire to seek out information and learn how to overcome the obstacles
            given by the system. It is kind of play-exploration with the ultimate reason of acquiring
            knowledge about systems or exploit their vulnerabilities. But hacking can also refer to
            many other disciplines, apart from computer sciences. It can mean many things. To withstand
            or put up with a difficult situation; to apply a trick, short-cut, skill, or novelty method
            to something to increase productivity, efficiency or ease; to chop or cut down in a rough
            manner; etcetera. Creative resistance towards institutions is very common in the context
            of journalism, activism, civil affairs, especially art, but usually these actions disrupt establishments
            and allow uncensored information to enter the realm of the public and become
            part of a discourse.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Let’s talk about walls. Walls are fascinating because of their duality. A wall is a
            defined as a structure built for defence. From old English - a divider. The wall is meant to
            divide space or to be a border between the outside and the inside (of a house, for example). Walls are the artificial borders of the world. They have a very strong political connotation as well. Everyone who wants power wants to build a wall. And that’s how walls get raised to divide people and land and appear as barriers to communication.</p>

    <div class="draggable_text" class="ui-widget-content2"> 
            <p class="paragraph">But in the process of their existence the character of walls takes on a different
            meaning. They become street galleries, where anyone can be an artist and express
            their creativity in public space. From means of separation, the wall turns into a space
            for open communication, criticism and personal expression. There are many walls in the
            world. But maybe there are many more people taking on these walls and opening up public
            space.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">In the history of art there are many movements that try to escape the institutionalisation of art and to create space for free, living art. The Dada and Fluxus artist for example promoted art forms that were outside of the norms imposed by cultural institutions, media
            production and high art. By engaging in self - defined artistic practices they broadened
            the understanding of what can be considered as art. Fluxus encouraged a “do-it-yourself”
            aesthetic. They refused the romantic idea of the artist as an individual with an
            outstanding gift and aimed not only to make art available to the masses, but wanted to
            engage them as active participants in it’s production. Fluxus art discredited the conventional
            market-driven art world. They have created their own means of expression and
            production, overcoming the existing institutional codes for the definition of art. Fluxus
            artists claimed their work to be “anti-art,” in order to emphasize the revolutionary mode of
            thinking about the practice and process, which involves a broadened understanding
            on the importance of art in the social context.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Our experience of others emerges in an inner dialogues in which out personal feelings
            are related to an external perceived reality and understanding of previous situations. Experience
            is the process of getting knowledge from doing, seeing, or feeling things. If we
            want to experience the world in a different way we must first start doing, seeing, feeling
            and thinking differently. The ways in which we interact and thereby create and share
            meaning are a vehicle for defining our personal and cultural identity. When we express
            ourselves, we stuff our thought in empty words, we use tools communicate and to distribute
            information, but that creates a world where human interaction becomes dependent on
            these tools and therefore limited to them. They have the power to shrink the understanding
            between us because there is no shared experience.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Except for when we cheat the rules and engage in an open dialogue with the people
            and the world around us. And than imagination and creativity helps us to open spaces for
            further interaction. Expression unleashes affect. Affect is what touches. Affect as a verb
            means to influence something. When we express ourselves we influence each other. We
            share meaning and value. This is how we ourselves create our reality.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">The rules and structures that are meant to govern our interaction are not absolute
            and can easily be changed, if we can distance ourselves from the situation so that we can
            critically observe it. There are ways to use these rules and structures in a way that contributes
            to our common experience, rather than to dominate it. When people engage and
            participate new possibilities and spaces emerge. Cooperation is an exchange in which
            participants benefit from the encounter. When we cooperate we accomplish what we
            can’t do alone.</p>

            play is a voluntary activity that occurs in a space isolated from the rest of life, away
